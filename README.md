# Senior-Project
Advertisement Interactive Website
The scope of the project was to allow users to send a tweet about a given product, which would appear on a billboard giving the user their own 15 seconds of fame. For the billboard my team members had used Unity to pull data from our database.

This program allowed users to log in using a valid twitter account, from there they could add and remove friends. View their friends profiles and edit their own profile information. The program also allowed users to select an advertisement and tweet about the specific product from their homepage which would send a tweet to twitter with the specific hashtag for the advertisement they had selected. For this project I had relied heavily on twitters API, as well as the programming languages SQL and Php.
